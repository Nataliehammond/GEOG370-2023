<h1>Homework 6: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Natalie Hammond</h2>
<h3>My map represents the median income level for each county in California. 
    The lowest income range is from $42,206-$56,378. The highest income range is $112,017-$140,258.
    Since this is median, it is not an average of incomes, but the middle value in the range of 
    incomes for all residents in a given county. The white/light purple counties correspond to 
    counties with lower median incomes, and dark purple counties have highest median incomes.
    This data is from 2022 Census data.
