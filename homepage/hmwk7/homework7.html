    <h3> Texas County School Dropout Rates, Grades 7-12</h3>
    <p> 
        I made this map of Texas with data from 2022. My county shapefile is from a Texas government website,
        and my school dropout data is from the Texas Education Agency. My data shows the school dropout rates in grades 7-12
        in ratio form. The dropout rate is defined by the Texas Education Agency as 
        (the number of students that dropped out in a school year / number of students enrolled in that year) * 100.
        My map shows higher dropout rates in some central Texas counties and Southern counties.
        I used natural breaks for my data.
